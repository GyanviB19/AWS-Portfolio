# üêæ AWS Data Analytics Platform: Animal Control Inventory Register 2024
<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project focuses on designing and implementing an AWS-based Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for analyzing Animal Control Inventory data from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal.
The objective is to clean, transform, and analyze animal impoundment trends using AWS S3, Glue, Glue DataBrew, Athena, and CloudWatch.

<h3>Project Title</h3>
AWS Data Analytic Platform for The City of Vancouver- Animal Control Inventory 2024

<h3>Objective</h3>
‚úî Analyze the distribution of animal breeds across different age categories. <br>‚úî Identify the most recent impoundment date for each age category.<br>  ‚úî Leverage AWS Glue, Glue DataBrew, and Athena to process and extract insights. <br>  ‚úî Ensure data security, cost optimization, and monitoring with AWS services.
